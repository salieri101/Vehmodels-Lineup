Vehmodels-Lineup
================

All vehicle models lined up on PIA runway with their model IDs shown in front of them

This is good for server owners/scripters who want to make an rp server and to 
add vehicles to it with Vehicle Manager from scratch without using 
the "default FreeRoam script that adds random vehs at random places around the map

A possible upgrade to this script can add  world change to it
